    "The objective of trajectory optimization is to generate, given an initial state and desired final goal state, a time-parametrized path (or trajectory) which minimizes a given performance metric (or cost function) while simultaneously satisfying a set of constraints. This problem is closely related to solving an open-loop optimal control problem. Moreover, it is usually considered a local planning problem because the goal is to generate a trajectory which terminates a few meters away from the current position of the robot, successively updating the termination point as the robot moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples of cost functions for trajectory generation in robotics are:\n",
    "- the energy required to follow the trajectory\n",
    "- the control effort (often related to energy) required\n",
    "- the average or maximum acceleration/jerk/snap \n",
    "- the time to execute the trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In robotics applications, the trajectory optimization output is usually fed as a motion control command for a robot, and thus has to satisfy strict requirements in terms of dynamic feasibility, smoothness, efficient re-computability, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples of constraints for trajectory generation in robotics are:\n",
    "- constraints from the environment such as obstacles (static or dynamic) that must be avoided\n",
    "- constraints on the performance of the system, such as the maximum control effort or saturations on the actuators of the robot\n",
    "- the final time and final state of the robot (e.g. when trying to intercept a moving object)\n",
    "- kinematic and dynamic constraints (e.g. a car cannot move sideways or a quadcopter cannot accelerate horizontally without pitching or rolling).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "The Trajectory optimization problem can be mathematically formulated as follows:\n",
    "$$\\min_{p} J(p)$$ $$ \\text{s.t.} \\\\ p \\in P$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $J(\\cdot)$ is the objective function, $p$ represents time-parameterized path found by the trajectory generator, and $P$ is the set of state trajectories that satisfies all given constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Techniques\n",
    "The typical techniques used to solve a trajectory optimization problem can be grouped in two cathegories:\n",
    "1. **Direct method:** iteratively construct a numerical approximation to the solution to the problem. \n",
    "2. **Indirect method:** analytically construct the direct and sufficent conditions for optimality, which are then solved numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Encoding\n",
    "Time for trajectory generation is generally handled in one of two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **fixed arrival time**\n",
    "2. **receding horizon**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, all the trajectories $p \\in P$ have to satisfy the additional constraint that the final state of the robot (position, velocity etc..) must be reached at the given time $T$.  In the second case, the trajectory is iteratively re-planned for a given, small time horizon. At every time step, the planner updates the current trajectory by re-planning a new trajectory with the final time increased one step from the previous final time. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the fixed arrival time approach has the advantage of minimizing the cost function along the entire trajectory, the receding horizon approach--despite offering a sub-optimal result--is less computationally expensive.\n",

    "A convex function can be formally defined as follows:\n",

    "A convex optimization problem is an optimization problem in which the objective function is a convex function and the feasible set is a convex set. It can be formulated as:\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\min_{x} f(x)$$\n",
    "$$\\text{subject to} \\\\ g_i(x) \\leq 0, \\ i=1, ..., m$$\n",
    "$$\\\\ h_i(x) \\leq 0, \\ i=1, ..., p$$\n",
    "where $f, g_1, \\cdots, g_m$ are convex and $h_1, \\cdots, h_p$ are affine constraints. It should be noted that affine constraints are indeed convex, but they are listed separately in this formulation for convenience. \n",
    "\n",
    "A convex optimization problem has the following properties:\n",
    "- every local minimum is a global minimum\n",
    "- the optimal set is convex\n",
    "- if the objective function is *strictly* convex, then the problem has at most one optimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are examples of convex optimization problems that are commonly encountered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Programming:** In linear programming, an optimization problem is characterized by a linear cost function, a linear set of inequality constraints, and non-negative variables. Geometrically, the inequlity constraints, which define the feasible region, describe a convex polyhedron. The linear objective function is a convex function, which implies that every local minimum is a global minimum. A solution is guaranteed to exist under the assumptions that the problem is feasible (e.g. having a non-empty feasible space) and that the problem is not unbounded. A linear program can be expressed mathematically as \n",

    "- **Mixed-Integer Linear Program:** A linear problem is said to be integral if it has at least one optimal solution which is integral. This means that the domain of some of the optimization variables $x$ is defined on $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
    "- **Quadratic Program:** A quadratic program is an optimization problem where the cost function is quadratic. A quadratic cost function has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^TQx + c^Tx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP):** If a quadratic program has constraints expressed in quadratic form (which can exist alongside linear or affine constraints such as $Ax = b$), then the problem is said to be quadratically constrained. Quadratic constraints can be expressed as:\n",

    "\n",
    "A scenario where the above VTOL has to navigate around obstacles to reach a desired position can be formulated as an MIQCP problem. For the simplified real-world problem of trajectory planning for the VTOL, the associated constraints include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a maximum speed on the vehicle\n",
    "- fixed start and end locations\n",
    "- a need to avoid static objects\n",
    "\n",
    "These constraints involve both the longitudinal and lateral dynamics, meaning that the longitudinal and lateral dynamics must be considered together. Furthermore, because of the need to avoid objects, the problem formulation requires the use of mixed integers to maintain the convexity of the problem space. Time will be encoded in a receding horizon fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections detail the various aspects of the MIQCP encoding of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Receding Horizon Formulation\n",
    "Given a planning horizon $T_\\text{hor}$ and sampling time $\\Delta t$, the number of discrete steps $N$ in the planning horizon is obtained as:\n",
    "$$N = \\frac{T_\\text{hor}}{\\Delta t}$$\n",
    "The discretized state and input vectors at the discrete time-step $k$, given the sampling time $\\Delta t$, are: \n",
    "$$x_k = [x_\\text{lat}(t_0 + k\\Delta t), \\ x_\\text{lon}(t_0 + k \\Delta t)]$$\n",
    "$$u_k = [u_\\text{lat}(t_0 + k\\Delta t), \\ u_\\text{lon}(t_0 + k \\Delta t)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective Function\n",
    "The objective function could look to minimize *fuel used, travel time, a combination of the two, or even a range of other functions*. The minimum control effort cost function (which is related to minimizing the energy used by the VTOL, since the square of the thrust force produced by the propellers is roughly proportional to the instant power consumption) will be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\min_{x(t) \\ u(t)} J(x(t), u(t), t)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$x(t) = [x^T_\\text{lat}(t), x^T_\\text{lon}(t)]^T \\in R^6$$ \n",
    "$$u(t) = [u^T_\\text{lat}(t), u^T_\\text{lon}(t)]^T \\in R^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the scalar $t_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary initial time and  $T \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the fixed total time to execute the trajectory and $R \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2\\times2}$ is a positive definite weight matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following standard techniques (FW-Euler integration), the continuous time cost function can be discretized:\n",
    "$$\\min J_k(x_k, u_k) = \\min (x_n - \\bar{x}_g)^TQ(x_n - \\bar{x}_g) + \\sum_{0}^{N-1}u_k^TRu_k$$\n",

    "#### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notation declaration*: for convenience, we drop the time-dependency notation $\\cdot(t)$, as it can be deduced without ambiguity from the context. \n",
    "\n",
    "The constraints considered for the problem are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Constraint: System Dynamics\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Note*: The system dynamics are written as an affine function, which is convex, as explained in the introduction of this work. The matrices $A = \\text{diag}([A_\\text{lat}, A_\\text{lon}])$ and $B = \\text{diag}([B_\\text{lat}, B_\\text{lon}])$ correspond to the linearized and discretized dynamic model of the VTOL, as defined in the Dynamic Model Section.\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be simply seen that the introduction of an obstacle into a convex area, including the vehicle and its destination, causes the area to become non-convex. This non-convexity is dealt with by formulating the problem as a mixed integer program with binary variables that vary depending on the region the vehicle is in at time *k*.

    "\n",
    "As was discussed in the introduction, convexity is an important property in optimization that generally guarantees the ability to find an optimal solution. The following are popular methods for solving convex optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient-Based Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, gradient-based methods calculate directional derivatives at each time steps and \"follow the gradient down to a minimum.\" Any implementation of the method requires the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A way to obtain a gradient of the objective function  \n",
    "2. A method for determining the \"step direction\" based on the gradient (and potentially additional information)  \n",
    "3. A way to determine a \"step size\" in the direction of the \"step direction\"  \n",
    "4. Stopping criterion to determine if the solution is \"close enough\" to a minimum  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Gradient descent\n",
    "Gradient descent calculates the gradient of the objective function and takes a step in the direction of the negative gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Steepest descent\n",
    "Steepest descent closely mimics gradient descent, but rather than stepping in the direction of the negative gradient, it determines the *most negative* direction from the local gradient and sets that as the \"step direction\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Newton's Method\n",
    "Newton's method can be thought of as gradient descent on a second-order Taylor approximation of the objective function. It entails transforming a linear-equality-constrained problem with a twice-differentiable objective function into a linear-equality-quadratic problem. The steps of the algorithm are summarized thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly sample a point in space, x    \n",
    "2. Calculate or approximate the local gradient of the function  \n",
    "3. Use this information (and potentially additional information) to determine the step direction and step size  \n",
    "4. Move the point, x, in the determined step direction by the determined step size   \n",
    "5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the point x has arrived at a minimum    \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: more sophisticated variants often vary the step size from step 3 based on factors such as the steepness of the gradient. Also, there is no one correct answer to determining whether x has reached a minimum. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interior Point Methods (IPM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interior point methods take an optimization problem with linear equality and inequality constraints and reshape it into a linear equality-constrained problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Barrier Method \n",
    "\n",
    "The Barrier Method is an IPM formulation in which general inequality constraints are made implicit by moving them into the objective function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the objective function is made to be infinite at any points which were previously outside of the feasible set as marked by the inequality constraints. This is done by use of an indicator function, $I(x)$. Formally the process can be expressed as:\n",
    "  \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "f(x) = f_0(x) + \\sum_{i=1}^mI(f_i(x))\\\\\n",
    "\\text{where: } I(u)=  \\left\\{\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "      0 & u \\leq 0 \\\\\n",
    "      \\infty & u \\gt 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{array} \n",
    "\\right.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f(x)$ is the objective function, $f_0(x)$ is the original objective function, $I(u)$ is the indicator function, and $f_i(x)$ represents the implicit inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this approach is elegant, it is not differentiable and does not lend itself to techniques such as Newton's Method. This drawback inspired the use of a logarithmic barrier function of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\hat{I}(u ) = -(1/t)log(-u)\\\\\n",
    "t \\gt 0\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "This alternative indicator function maintains the convexity and differentiability of the problem while allowing for good approximation of the original barrier. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: increasing the value of $t$ increases the accuracy of the approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Primal-Dual Method\n",
    "Without delving into the details, the Primal-Dual IPM is included as a common technique. There are many excellent resources on the underlying mechanics of Primal-Dual methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simplex Method\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: Dantzig's Simplex Method is only valid for linear programs, and does not generalize to the greater class of convex optimization problems. Regardless, it is briefly covered here for completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplex method leverages the inherent monotonicity of a linear program, as well as the linear objective function and the feasible set that can be represented as a convex polytope. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the objective function is monotonic and the feasible set is defined by linear inequalities, it can be shown that if an optimal point exists it will be at one of the vertices of the convex polytope. As a result, the algorithm simply begins at one such vertex and follows the connected edge of the polytope which is most rapidly approaching an optimal solution of the objective function (the edge with the most negative gradient in the case of minimization). This process continues until the algorithm reaches the optimal point within the polytope.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: in the case of a feasible set that is an open convex polytope, it is possible for the optimal solution to not exist, as the simplex method may discover an unbounded edge. In this case, the solution is not feasible and further constraints must be imposed upon the feasible set to allow for a solution.\n",
