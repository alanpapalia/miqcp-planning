    "## Introduction to Trajectory Optimization\n",
    "The objective of trajectory optimization is to generate a time-parametrized path (a trajectory) which minimizes a given performance metric, while satisfying a set of constraints. This problem is closely  related to solving an optimal control, open-loop problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In robotic applications, the planned trajectory is usually fed  as input to the motion control architecture of the robot, and has to satisfy strict requirements in terms of dynamic feasibility, smoothness, ability to be re-computed efficienty... \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of performance metric for trajectory generation commonly found in robotics are:\n",
    "- the energy required to follow the trajectory\n",
    "- the control effort (often related to energy) required\n",
    "- the average or maximum acceleration/jerk/snap \n",
    "- the time to execute the trakjectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of constraints for trajectory generation typically found in robotics are:\n",
    "- constraints from the environment, such as obstacles, static or dynamic, that must be avoided\n",
    "- constraints on the performance of the system, such as the maximum control effort, or saturations on the actuators of the robot\n",
    "- the final time and final state of the robot (e.g. when trying to intercept a moving object)\n",
    "- kinematic and dynamic constraints (e.g. a car cannot move sideways or a quadcopter cannot accelerate horizonatally without pitching or rolling).\n",
    "\n",
    "Trajectory optimization is usually considered as a local planning problem, since we are only interested in generating a trajectory which terminates a few meters away from the current position of the robot (but the termination point is constantly updated as the robot moves). In addition, trajectory optimizatio assumes that a desired initial state and final goal state are given (for example by a global planner/mission planner).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical formulation\n",
    "The Trajectory optimizatio problem can be mathematically formulated as follows:\n",
    "$$\\min_{p} J(p)$$ $$ \\text{s.t.} \\\\ p \\in P$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $J(\\cdot)$ is the objective function, $p$ represents all the possible input and state trajectories, and $P$ is the set of state trajectory satisfying given constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Techniques used to solve the trejectory optimization problem\n",
    "The typical techniques used to solve a trajectory optimization problem can be grouped in two cathegories:\n",
    "- Direct method: iteratively construct a numerical approximation to the solution to the problem. \n",
    "- Indirect method: analytically constructs the direct and sufficent conditions for optimality, which are then solved numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Planning horizon\n",
    "The trajectory can be usually planned w.r.t to a __fixed arrival time__ or on a __receding-horizon__ fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, all the trajectories $p$ in $P$ have to satisfy the additional constraint that the final state of the robot (position, velocity etc..) must be reached at the given time $T$.  In the second case, the trajectory is iteratively replanned for a given, small time horizon. At every time-step, the planner updates the current trajectory by re-planning a new trajectory with final time increased of one step from the previous final time. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the first approach has the advantage of minimizing the cost function along the entire trajectory, the second approach - despite offering a sub-optimal result - is less computationally expensive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory_optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formulating the Problem as MIQCP\n",
    "\n",
    "In our simplified real world problem of a vehicle planning its trajectory through space, our **constraints** include all of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a maximum speed on the vehicle\n",
    "- fixed start and end locations\n",
    "- a need to avoid static objects\n",
    "\n",
    "While taking these into account, our **objective function** could look to minimize: *fuel used, travel time, a combination of the two, or even a range of other functions*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the need to avoid objects, our problem formulation requires the use of **mixed integers** to maintain the convexity of the problem space. We will start with a brief overview of convexity for completeness."

    "A convex optimization problem is an optimization problem in which the objective function is a convex function and the feasible set is a convex set. It can be formulated in the form:\n",

    "$$\\text{subject to} \\\\ g_i(x) \\leq 0, \\ i=1, ..., m$$\n",
    "$$\\\\ h_i(x) \\leq 0, \\ i=1, ..., p$$\n",
    "where $f, g_1, ..., g_m$ are convex and $h_1, ..., h_p$ are affine constraints (note: affine constraints are indeed convex, but they are listed separately in this formulation for conveniency). \n",
    "\n",
    "Under these assumption, the problem has the following properties:\n",
    "- every local minimum is a global minimum\n",
    "- the optimal set is convex\n",
    "- if the objective function  is strictly convex, then the problem has at most one optimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Linear Programming\n",
    "In linear programming, an optimization problem is characterized by:\n",
    "- a linear cost function\n",
    "- a linear set of inequality constraints\n",
    "- non negative variables\n",

    "$$ \\text{subject to} \\\\ Ax\\leq b \\\\x \\geq 0 $$ \n",
    " \n",
    "Geometrically, the inequlity constraints, which define the feasible region, describe a convex polyhedron. The linear objective function is a convex function, which implies that every local minimum is a global minimum. A LP/MILP is then a convex optimization problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Mixed Integer Linear Programming\n",

    "## Solving Convex Optimization Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've spent the time to understand convex spaces, it is time to discuss how to use this *magical* property called convexity to reach optimal solutions. As we've discussed, convexity is an important property that generally allows us to guarantee that we can find an optimal solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond living in a convex space, the other requirement of a convex optimization problem is that the actual **function** being optimized is also **convex**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two requirements, both a convex set and function, enforce the rule that **any local minima is also a global minima**. That's correct, please read that again. **Local minima = Global Minima**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without further information, here is a primer on some common convex optimization approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique does what any intelligent person would do when trying to find a minima: follow a path leading down. A gradient based method requires the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A way to obtain a gradient of the function  \n",
    "2) Method of determining the \"step direction\" based upon the gradient and potential additional information  \n",
    "3) A way to determine a \"step size\" in the direction of this \"step direction\"  \n",
    "4) Stopping criterion to determine if the solution is \"close enough\" to a minima  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient descent\n",
    "Gradient descent calculates gradient of function and takes a step in the direction of the negative gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steepest descent\n",
    "Steepest descent closely mimics gradient descent, but rather than stepping in the direction of the negative gradient it determines the most negative direction from the local gradient and sets that as the \"step direction\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Newton's Method\n",
    "Newton's method can be simply considered a minimizer of 2nd order Taylor approximation. It is effectively transforming a linear equality constrained problem with a twice differentiable objective function into linear equality quadratic problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Randomly sample a point in space, x    \n",
    "2) Calculate or approximate the local gradient of the function  \n",
    "3) Use this information and potentially additional information to determine step direction and step size  \n",
    "3) Move the point, x, in the determined step direction by the determined step size   \n",
    "4) Repeat steps 2,3 until the point x has been determined to be in a minima    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: more sophisticated variants often vary the step size from step 3 based upon factors such as the steepness of the gradient. Also, there is no one correct answer to guessing whether a x has reached a minima. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Interior Point Methods (IPM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interior point methods take an optimization problem with linear equality and inequality constraints and reshape into linear equality constrained problems\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Barrier Method \n",
    "\n",
    "The Barrier Method is an IMP formulation in which general inequality constraints are made implicit by moving them into the objective function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the objective function is made to be infinite at any points which were previously outside of the feasible set as marked by the inequality constraints. This is done by use of an indicator function, $I(x)$. Formally speaking, this can be said as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x)$ is the objective function  \n",
    "$f_0(x)$ is the original objective function  \n",
    "$I(u)$ is the indicator function  \n",
    "$f_i(x)$ represents the implicit inequalities  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "f(x) = f_0(x) + \\sum_{i=1}^mI(f_i(x))\\\\\n",
    "\\text{where: } I(u)=  \\left\\{\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "      0 & u \\leq 0 \\\\\n",
    "      \\infty & u \\gt 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{array} \n",
    "\\right.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "While this formulation is elegant, it is **not differentiable** and does not lend itself to techniques such as Newton's Method. This inspired the use of a **logarithmic barrier** of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\hat{I}(u ) = -(1/t)log(-u)\\\\\n",
    "t \\gt 0\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "This alternative indicator function maintains the convexity and differentiability of the problem while allowing for good approximation of the original barrier. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: increasing the value of $t$ increases the accuracy of the approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primal-Dual Method\n",
    "Without becoming overly complex, we choose to mention the Primal-Dual IPM as a common technique used to solve interior point methods. There are many excellent resources on the underlying mechanics of these methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplex Method\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Dantzig's Simplex Method is only valid for **linear programs**, and does not generalize to the greater class of convex optimization problems. Regardless, it is briefly covered here for completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplex method leverages the inherent monotonicity of a linear program and bears the relatively strict requirements of an LP such as a linear objective function and a feasible set which can be represented as a convex polytope. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the objective function is monotonic and the feasible set is defined by linear inequalities, it can be shown that if an optimal point exists it will be at one of the vertices of the convex polytope. As a result, the algorithm simply begins at one such vertex and follows the connected edge of the polytope which is most rapidly approaching an optimal solution of the objective function (the edge with the most negative gradient in the case of minimization). This behavior continues until the algorithm reaches the optimal point within the polytope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: in the case of a feasible set that is an open convex polytope it is possible for the optimal solution to not exist, as the simplex method may discover an unbounded edge. In this case, the solution is not feasible and further constraints must be imposed upon the feasible set to allow for a solution.\n",
