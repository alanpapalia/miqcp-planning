    "Though the concept of convexity extends to n-dimensions, we will focus on convexity of a 2D space for navigation. It can be simply seen that the introduction of an obstacle into a convex area including the vehicle and its destination, will cause the area to become non-convex. \n",

    "We work around this non-convexity by formulating the problem as a mixed integer program, with binary variables that vary depending on the region the vehicle is in at time *k*. These variables allow for all constraints to be flexibly satisfied **without having to address the combinatoric nature of the \"or\" formulation??????**.\n",
